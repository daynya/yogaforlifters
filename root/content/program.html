    Lifting creates tightness in our bodies, and it should! But this tightness can also prevent 
    us from being comfortable and functional in our day to day lives, and can even lead to injuries.
    Just a few minutes a day can help you get to a place of balance.

    If you take good care of your body, it can take good care of you. Just like you would go 
    get a massage, you can implement a short routine into your day to help break up some of the 
    tension and tightness that has built up from your training sessions. Give your muscles some love,
    and thank them for all they do for you every day.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <li class="question">Q: I've never done yoga because I'm not flexible. Are you sure this is for me?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: The first time you walked into a gym, did you look at the bench press and decide
        to never lay down on it because you have never benched before? Likely not. Yoga MAKES us
        flexible. Being flexible is not a requirement for starting a practice. You add in these 
        stretches to open your body. If you're already open enough, then you may not need to be here.
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: No, like I can't even touch my toes. I don't think I can do yoga.</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: Right. See above. There are modifications for anything and everything in yoga. Just like
        when you front squat, if you can't hold a "proper" front rack position (raising hand), there
        are alternative approaches so that you still get the benefit of the exercise. Same thing here.
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: I've heard that being too flexible is bad for my gains?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: I would agree. Being TOO flexible is bad for one's gains. The trick here
        is finding the line and implementing just the right amount of flexibility.
        You want to make sure that your body is able to move through life with ease, comfort
        and agility. Your life outside of the working out is important, and you need to implement
        physical practices that support your goals, inside and outside of the gym.
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: What if I'm not looking for a spiritual practice?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: GREAT! I'm not trying to make anything about this spiritual for you. 
        I use yoga as a tool to connect to my body and my breath. If you feel called to 
        go deeper in your practice and want to connect to this practice on a spiritual level,
        be my guest. I can even point you in a few directions to explore. 
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: I do some foam rolling before my workouts - isn't that enough?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: That is awesome that you are trying to incorporate some self-myofascial release. 
        I am a fan of foam rolling, as well. If you feel like it's enough for you, then, great!
        If you're having muscle tightness or discomfort, or you feel that some flexibility would 
        help your athletic and non-athletic pursuits, then you likely need to add something else.
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: Will yoga help heal my injury?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: I am not a doctor, and nothing I am saying here should be taken as medical advice.
        I strongly suggest working with a physical therapist, chiropractor, massage therapist, 
        and anyone else you trust to help guide you through your recovery. They may recommend 
        adding in some yoga, and can tell you what to try. In general, I feel that yoga should be
        added in to the routine of a healthy, uninjured athlete to maintain a healthy body.

    <li class="question">Q: I'm actually enjoying this addition to my workout days. Is there an option for more?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: Boy, is there! Contact me for more info!
