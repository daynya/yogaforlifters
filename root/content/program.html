    Lifting creates tightness in our bodies, and it should! But this tightness can also prevent 
    us from being comfortable and functional in our day to day lives, and can even lead to injuries.
    Whether you have just a few minutes each day, or time to dig into this further, yoga can help
    you restore a natural balance in your strong ass body.

    If you take good care of your body, it can take good care of you. Similar to benefits from a 
    massage, yoga will help get deep into that tissue and offset the hard work you're asking it to 
    do for you in the gym. Give your muscles some love, and thank them for all they do for you every day.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <li class="question">Q: I've never done yoga because I'm not flexible. Are you sure this is for me?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: The first time you walked into a gym, did you look at the bench press and decide
        to never lay down on it because you have never benched before? Likely not. Yoga MAKES us
        flexible. Being flexible is not a requirement for starting a practice. You add in these 
        stretches to open your body. If you're already open enough, then you may not need to be here.
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: I can't even touch my toes, I don't think I can do yoga?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: Right. See above. There are modifications for anything and everything in yoga. Just like
        when you front squat, if you can't hold a "proper" front rack position (raising hand), there
        are alternative approaches so that you still get the benefit of the exercise and work towards
        the proper positioning. Same thing here.
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: I've heard that being too flexible is bad for my strength?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: If you are here, it is likely that you aren't practicing yoga for hours each day. 
        It's not likely that you're going to get "too flexible" from incorporating a small amount
        of yoga. Just like you can't lift for two weeks and get "too bulky", it's something you really
        need to work toward. I believe there are some old school notions that say strength and flexibility
        are at odds with one another. It is my personal belief that the reality is a balance of the two.
        Being more flexible lets your body function more optimally and aids in recovery. This, in turn, allows 
        you to lift more, and be safer and healthier in general.
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: What if I'm not looking for a spiritual practice?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: GREAT! I'm not trying to make anything about this spiritual for you. 
        I use yoga as a tool to connect to my body and my breath. If you feel called to 
        go deeper in your practice and want to connect to this practice on a spiritual level,
        be my guest. I can even point you in a few directions to explore. 
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: I do some foam rolling before my workouts - isn't that enough?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: That is awesome that you are trying to incorporate some self-myofascial release. 
        I am a fan of foam rolling, as well. If you feel like it's enough for you, then, great!
        If you're having muscle tightness or discomfort, or you feel that some flexibility would 
        help your athletic and non-athletic pursuits, then you likely need to add something else.
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: What if I just add a few stretches in before I lift?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: Stretching prior to lifting is not something I can recommend. I believe that this concept
        is part of why yoga/being flexible seems at odds with lifting heavy weights. Stretching cold
        muscles can lead to injury, just like walking into the gym and picking up 500 pounds without 
        warming up first can. If you want to add a few stretches to your training, I recommend keeping 
        that as your cool down, post-lift. Prior to lifting, stick to a few dynamic movements to help
        prep your body for what's ahead. 
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: I don't have time for this. How am I supposed to fit this into my day?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: You have as much time as the rest of us do. We all have priorities and goals. The think is, 
        you make time for what you think is important. If you realize that this is a key to progressing
        your strength while caring for your body, you will make time for it. You have the ability to make 
        time for whatever you want. If it's a couple of minutes per day, that's a great start. Ideally,
        you'd be able to also do a longer session on a rest day. A deeper restoration for your body will 
        lead to a more relaxed body and mind. Who doesn't need that?
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: Will yoga help heal my injury?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: I am not a doctor, and nothing I am saying here should be taken as medical advice.
        I strongly suggest working with a physical therapist, chiropractor, massage therapist, 
        and anyone else you trust to help guide you through your recovery. They may recommend 
        adding in some yoga, and can tell you what to try. In general, I feel that yoga should be
        added in to the routine of a healthy, uninjured athlete to maintain a healthy body.
    </li>
    <li class="question">Q: I'm actually enjoying this addition to my workout days. Is there an option for more?</li>
    <li class="answer">
        A: Heck yes! I have a weekly program that offers you a longer class for rest days. This will take you 
        on a deeper journey to restoring balance in your body, and mind. <a class="link" href="#">Click here for more info.</a>
