When starting a new project, copy this root folder to new project folder.
Create new html or md files in the "content" folder. New css and img files go here, too.
Set up page.html as the template that these files will use. 
Generated files will go into a build folder. This is not where anything is written, and can be deleted.
Link to css file(s) in the template.

Create a .gitignore file (save as file type: all) with the word build in it only. Save this to the root folder of the project.
This will prevent the build files from being committed to git.
