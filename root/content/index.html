<h1>Do You Even Yoga, Bro?</h1>
<h3>Do you spend your time maxing your squat, building your guns, and counting your reps?</h3>
<p>
    If you live in the gym, it's likely that your body needs a little help unwinding. 
    It's quick and easy to incorporate just a little effort to help your body recover. 
    I can show you how adding in a little stretching, gentle mobility, and breathing
    can compliment your hours logged in the gym.

<h2>Hi, I'm Daynya. I'm a powerlifter, and a certified yoga instructor.</h2>
<p>
    I speak from personal experience when I say that when you are pushing your body,
    you need to give it some extra love to help offset that hard work. I have personally
    experienced injuries as a result of not putting time into taking care of my muscles. 
    I can help you avoid this pitfall of long hours logged in the gym.

<h2>What is STRONG ASS YOGA?</h2>
<p>
    If you're already spending time in the gym each day warming up (let's hope?) and training,
    then you owe it to yourself to care for your body on the back end as well. 
</p>
<h3>
    If you're a powerlifter, weightlifter, crossfitter, bodybuilder, general gym rat or 
    fitness enthusiast and you are not spending time each week to care for your muscles, 
    I can help.

    I have created a short sequence that you can add in to your workout days that can 
    help you unwind, relax, and recover more deeply. You don't need fancy equipment or to
    go to a yoga studio. You can do it in your living room, bedroom, porch, wherever you feel
    comfortable. It will help you recover from the stresses of training, and work toward 
    becoming an even stronger, more balanced lifter.
