<h2>Hello, gym friend! I'm Daynya, and I am so glad you're here.</h2>
<p>
    I learned the hard way that the harder we are on something, the quicker it wears out.
    If we are pushing our bodies to extremes, we need to be caring for them on the backend.
    This means not only sleep and nutrition, but also caring for our muscles and our joints.
    Just like you can maximize the enjoyment of your job by taking days off to relax, 
    you can get even more out of your gym routine by taking time to care for your physical being.
</p>
<p>
    Strengthening our muscles makes them tight. Tightness is very important for heavy lifting.
    However, tightness also leads to imbalances and day-to-day discomfort. This may be impacting 
    your sleep, your desk job, sitting on the floor, or even bending over to tie your shoes.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not suggesting that you give up lifting and practice yoga every day (unless that's what you're looking for, in which case, great!). I realize this is 
    counter-productive to how much work you are putting into your strength pursuits. But if you
    give it just a few minutes a day, I can help guide you through listening to your body. 
    It will tell you what needs to be given some attention. If we can learn to tune into our 
    bodies, we can become even stronger in the gym. 
</p>

    Perhaps you already practice visualization. If not, you are missing out on a key component
    of not only lifting, but of manifesting what you want in your life. A short, daily meditation
    can help you learn to not be distracted by thoughts. Once you learn to calm your mind, you can 
    also hone the power of seeing what it is that you want to create in life.

<h2>My story</h2>
<p>
    I have been practicing yoga for 15 years, and have been a certified yoga instructor since 2008.
    I have been lifting weights off and on for 10 years, and competing as a powerlifter for 3 years.
    My body has seen tightness, injuries, and discomfort. It has also seen PRs, strength gains, and physique changes.
</p>
<p>
    I had a minor injury to my lower back in 2017. I didn't listen to my body, and jumped back 
    into it too quickly. One day, I was squatting a relatively normal working weight for me at the time. 
    Even though something felt off, I kept pushing because I had been told that my back was fine.
    Not my smartest move. I ended up dropping to the floor of the gym, unable to move for a while.
    After a few months of rehab work with an amazing physical therapist, I was back at it. 
</p>
<p>
    During this time, I realized that I had been neglecting my normal yoga practice. I dove back into it, 
    but I also was hearing a lot of information indicating that yoga might be the wrong move for a powerlifter.
    These sources said that you don't want to get too flexible, because you can't be strong and flexible, you want to be as tight as possible. 
    On the surface, that makes sense. To an extent, I do agree. I don't think it's wise to spend 4 days a week
    working on deep spinal flexion and then go into the gym and attempt to PR your squats. However, there is 
    a way to balance the two. A little bit of work on flexibility may just help you get that low-bar position
    that you're struggling with or alleviate that discomfort when you try to sit cross-legged on the floor with your kids.
</p>
<p>
    I knew I had to make a change in my routine. When I asked my friends how much yoga they did to offset 
    their lifting, I got blank stares. So I thought that it might be helpful to put together some poses 
    that anyone can implement and add to their fitness routine. If you have questions, please don't hesitate to
